* Let's build a simple static web application
* Create an __index.html__ file in a folder called __public__ with the following code

``` html
<html>
	<body>
		<h1>NodeJS Training</h1>
	</body>	
</html>
```
* Create a file _webserver.js_ in a folder called __src__
* Use http and fs modules in this file in such a way that, you start the server in port 3000 and run http://localhost:3000, in the browser, you should get the index.html as response.
