* Create two files _MyMath.js_ and _Lab02.js_
* In __MyMath.js__ implement two functions __add__ and __greatest__ that can take any number of arguments and print the sum and the largest. You can invoke them like this.

``` javascript
//This code is present in Lab02.js 

add(1,5,34,324,324,235,2353);
add(21,65);
add(1,55,83);

greatest(1,5,34,324,324,235,2353);
greatest(21,65);
greatest(1,55,83,9,667);
``` 

* Hint: Loop through __arguments__ keyword :)

* Import MyMath.js in Lab02.js and run it
