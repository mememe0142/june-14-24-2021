### Javascript

* Functions are first-class citizens
* You can define a function with any number of arguments, but invoke it with any number of arguments
* You can define a function with the same name any number of times, the latest definition overrides the previous ones
* All the function definitions are run first; then the execution(intepretation) starts from the 1st line
