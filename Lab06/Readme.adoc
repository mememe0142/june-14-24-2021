* When you guess the number correct, display a message "You've got it!!!"
* If the user enters an invalid input, display an error message (Invalid Input) in red
* You can use express-session library to store the values in session, so every user plays her own game 
* Don't worry too much about the look and feel of the page
* Don't give up.
